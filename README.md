# Installation
```
npm install termfx
```

# Usage
**Note:** An update has been planned to remove the need to explicitly declare if the file is CRLF or LF break files!

```js
import termfx from "termfx";
```

`termfx()` is the main class, create a new instance of this!
The instance of termfx has three main functions, two of them registering variables and functions, the third being the executer.

`registerVariable` - Takes in two strings, the first is the replacer(or tag) and the second is the "to be replaced".
`registerFunction` - Takes in a string and a function, the first one being the tag, the second one being the function that can be executed.

`execute` - Takes a string and writer(a function/method), the string template is parsed. Any regular strings that are not variable/function tags will be executed by the writer. Variable tags will be replaced and functions will be executed with respect to the parameters that were provided in the string template.

## Examples:
```js
import termfx from "termfx";
const registry = new termfx();

registry.registerVariable("foo", "bar");
registry.registerFunction("sleep",
  function(delayInms){
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayInms));
  }
);

const string =
`<<sleep(1000)>>that was 1 second
<<sleep(5000)>>that was 5 seconds
<<$foo>> <- this is a variable replacer!`;
```

## Carriage Return Line Feed Files
Also known as CRLF, this is what most files termfx is supposedly parsing, files are expected to have `\r\n` at the end of each line. This mode will not add a carriage return `\r` at the end of each line.
```js
import termfx from "termfx";
const registry = new termfx();
```
## Line feed
Also known as LF, these type of files **do not** have a carriage return character at the end of each line(`\r`). A `\r` character will be added to the end of every line.  This is used to handle the issue where everything is output in 1 line by the writer.
```js
import termfx from "termfx";
const registry = new termfx({
  carriageReturn: true
});
```

## Custom delimiters
Using a custom delimiters that isn't the default `<<`, `>>`.
```js
// custom delimiters
import termfx from "termfx";
const registry = new termfx({ delimiters: ["[[", "]]"] });
// E.g. This will now allow you to use [[$tag]] instead of <<$tag>>
```
